                The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ATRS), entrusted with the retirement security of public educators, channels significant capital into a global financial system that sustains and profits from the Israeli apartheid regime. This dossier maps the pipeline through which teachers' deferred wages are invested in corporations that arm, supply, and support the ongoing occupation of Palestine.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 font-serif">I. The Mechanisms of Complicity</h2>
            <p>ATRS's complicity is structured primarily through its holdings in broad market index funds and other pooled investment vehicles managed by global asset management firms like <strong class="font-semibold">BlackRock</strong> and <strong class="font-semibold">Loomis Sayles</strong>. This passive investment strategy leads to a channeling of capital into companies involved in human rights abuses, often without active ethical decision-making. This "complicity by default" is a structural feature of modern finance that does not absolve the investor of responsibility.</p>
            <p>While Arkansas Act 411 mandates that ATRS investment decisions be based on "pecuniary factors" only, this creates a potential "accountability gap" where the fund remains financially linked to companies involved in severe human rights controversies, as these violations are not yet universally priced in as material financial risks.</p>
