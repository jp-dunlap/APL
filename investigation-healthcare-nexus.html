                A systemic entanglement of Arkansas's healthcare and pension systems with the economy of the Israeli apartheid state and its supporting military-industrial complex. This investigation reveals a deeply embedded complicity that extends from pharmaceutical procurement and financial investments to academic partnerships, exposing the mechanisms through which Arkansas institutions contribute to and profit from oppression.

            <p>The flow of capital from Arkansas's healthcare sector to Israeli corporate interests, particularly Teva Pharmaceuticals, represents a significant form of complicity. Seemingly routine mechanisms of pharmaceutical procurement—state formularies, hospital purchasing, and major insurance payers—create a systemic pipeline that channels Arkansas healthcare dollars towards an Israeli multinational implicated in the economic structures of occupation.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">The State of Arkansas Formulary guides drug selection and reimbursement, creating a direct channel for public and private healthcare funds to benefit Teva Pharmaceuticals, an Israeli multinational. High-revenue branded drugs like AJOVY and UZEDY, alongside widely used generics for conditions like asthma (Albuterol HFA), diabetes (Liraglutide), and ADHD (Amphetamine Salts), are included. This state-sanctioned inclusion ensures a steady revenue stream from Arkansas to Teva.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif">Teva's Operational Complicity in Occupied Palestine</h3>
                     <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Teva systematically benefits from the Israeli occupation by exploiting a "captive Palestinian market." This is facilitated by the Paris Protocol, which subordinates the Palestinian economy to Israeli control. Teva enjoys unimpeded market access, while Palestinian pharmaceutical companies face severe restrictions on development, import, and export. This controlled environment shields Teva from competition and allows it to profit directly from the structures of apartheid, making any revenue from Arkansas a contribution to a corporation embedded in occupation.</p>

            <p>The financial arteries of Arkansas's most prominent public and private institutions are demonstrably intertwined with corporations that fuel and profit from the Israeli military apparatus. This section uncovers the investments held by institutions dedicated to healing, education, and public service, exposing a profound ethical dissonance.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">The University of Arkansas Foundation manages over \$1.9 billion in assets to support the UA System, including UAMS. To generate returns, its endowments are invested in diversified portfolios that highly likely include major defense contractors like RTX (Raytheon), Lockheed Martin, and Boeing. This creates a stark contradiction: an institution dedicated to health and knowledge may simultaneously profit from corporations whose products inflict death and injury in Palestine.</p>

This directly contravenes its stated mission and the ethical principles of a faith-affiliated provider.</p>

A substantial portion is invested in equities through large asset managers like BlackRock and State Street, which are top institutional holders of major defense contractors like RTX. This means Arkansas teachers' deferred wages are invested in corporations that manufacture the instruments of war and repression, tying their financial security to global insecurity.</p>

            <p>Beyond direct financial flows, a more insidious form of complicity operates within Arkansas's academic and research spheres. Partnerships between Arkansas institutions and Israeli entities, presented under the neutral banner of "scientific progress," serve to normalize and legitimize the Israeli state, whitewashing its image while ignoring the systemic oppression of Palestinians.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">The public association between UAMS and the ICRF, which exclusively funds cancer research within Israel, lends UAMS's institutional prestige to an Israeli national fund. This engagement occurs in a political vacuum, ignoring the severe restrictions faced by Palestinian academics and scientists. The shared commitment to fighting cancer is used to overshadow the realities of apartheid, thereby normalizing the Israeli state as a legitimate international partner.</p>

The founders of Salvador Technologies have over a decade of experience in the National Cyber Unit and Intelligence corps of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). This partnership directly links Arkansas academic innovation with Israeli firms that have strong ties to the Israeli military and intelligence apparatus, contributing to the technological capabilities of a state engaged in occupation.</p>
