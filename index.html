                <p>
                    The struggle for Palestinian liberation is not confined to a distant land. It is here, woven into the fabric of our local economy, our political institutions, and our communities. Decisions made in Little Rock and Bentonville directly enable and sustain a system of apartheid and military occupation thousands of miles away. Corporations headquartered in Arkansas profit from this system, while our elected officials use our political power to shield it from accountability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project rejects the myth of separation. We operate from a simple, unshakeable premise: there is a direct line from the Natural State to the occupation of Palestine. Our mission is to make that line visible. We weaponize data—meticulously sourced, rigorously verified, and presented with unapologetic clarity—to expose the architecture of complicity that runs through our state. This is not merely an archive; it is an active front in the struggle for justice.
