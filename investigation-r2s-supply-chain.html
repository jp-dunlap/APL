                A deep-dive forensic analysis identifying the top U.S.-based sub-tier suppliers for Israel's Tamir missile. This report maps the specific corporate nodes, high-technology components, and logistical chokepoints that form the material foundation of the Raytheon-Rafael Strategic Systems (R2S) facility in Camden, Arkansas, transforming an abstract understanding of the military supply chain into an actionable map of its decentralized, material components.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 font-serif">I. Executive Summary: The Anatomy of the Kill Chain</h2>
            <p>This investigation confirms that the R2S facility in Camden is the terminal point of a vast, interdependent, and geographically dispersed sub-tier supply web. The production of Tamir and SkyHunter missiles is wholly dependent on a network of specialized U.S. corporations that provide the most critical, high-technology components. This report identifies the five most indispensable suppliers whose products constitute the core of the missile's functionality: the propulsion, guidance, and ordnance systems. Exposing this network decentralizes the struggle against the Camden facility, creating new fronts for political action, public pressure, and labor organizing at more vulnerable corporate nodes across the United States.</p>

            <p>The following dossiers provide a detailed analysis of the corporate entities that form the indispensable foundation of the R2S-Camden kill chain. These companies are not peripheral actors; they are the manufacturers of the core technologies that enable the Tamir and SkyHunter missile systems to function.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">L3Harris is arguably the most critical single node in the supply chain. Its Aerojet Rocketdyne division, with its "Center of Excellence" located directly within the Camden defense hub, is a dominant force in missile propulsion. Furthermore, its facility in Cincinnati, OH, is a leading producer of proximity fuzes, the critical technology that allows an interceptor to detonate near its target without direct impact.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Northrop Grumman possesses the industrial capacity to supply nearly every critical subsystem of the missile. Its deep integration across the defense sector makes it a foundational pillar of the entire U.S. missile production base. The company's advanced composite manufacturing capabilities, likely centered at its Iuka, MS, facility, are essential for producing the lightweight, durable airframes required for high-performance interceptors.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Moog is a highly specialized and indispensable supplier. The FCAS is the electromechanical system that translates the missile's digital guidance commands into the precise physical movements of its steering fins. Without this technology, the missile cannot be guided. Moog's market dominance in this niche, high-precision field makes it a critical and potentially irreplaceable chokepoint in the supply chain.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Leonardo DRS specializes in the sophisticated sensors that function as the missile's "eyes," allowing it to detect and track targets. The Tamir missile relies on an EO/IR seeker to lock onto its target in the terminal phase of an intercept. The advanced sensors produced by firms like Leonardo DRS are a core enabling technology for the entire Iron Dome system.</p>

These Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) facilities produce the essential propellants required by SRM manufacturers like L3Harris and Northrop Grumman. Without BAE's production, there is no propulsion.</p>

            <p>The mapping of the R2S supply web reveals a profound strategic vulnerability. The production of Israel's premier missile defense system is not a self-contained operation within a hardened Arkansas facility; it is a decentralized process critically dependent on a handful of specialized corporate actors located across the politically contested terrain of the United States.</p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800">This intelligence fundamentally alters the strategic calculus for anti-war and Palestine solidarity movements. It provides a concrete, evidence-based list of new corporate targets that are more accessible and potentially more susceptible to pressure than the prime contractor, RTX. The key vulnerabilities are:</p>
                <ul class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-4 space-y-3 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Geographic Decentralization:</strong> The struggle against the Camden facility can now be waged in Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Mississippi. This allows for the mobilization of local and regional allies, transforming a single-point campaign into a distributed, nationwide effort.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Labor as a Contested Terrain:</strong> The IAMAW unionization drive at the L3Harris SRM plant in Camden is the most significant and actionable vulnerability identified. Supporting this labor struggle is now a primary strategic imperative for the anti-war movement. A successful unionization effort that builds anti-war solidarity could create a material disruption at the most critical chokepoint in the entire propulsion supply chain.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Specialized Production as a Weakness:</strong> Companies like Moog Inc. are indispensable due to their specialization. This also makes them uniquely vulnerable. Unlike a massive, diversified conglomerate like RTX, a company focused on a niche technology is more sensitive to reputational damage and consumer pressure that could affect its other business lines.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 italic">By deconstructing the supply chain, we deconstruct the illusion of an invulnerable, monolithic military-industrial complex.
