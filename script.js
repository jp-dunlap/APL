    // --- FUTURE INTERACTIVITY ---
    // This file will house the logic for all future interactive features.
    // Potential enhancements include:
    //
    // 1. MODAL DOSSIERS:
    //    - Adding click event listeners to the cards in the "Adversary Ledger".
    //    - On click, dynamically creating and displaying a modal window (pop-up)
    //      with detailed dossier information fetched from a JSON file or API.
    //
    // 2. DYNAMIC DATA LOADING:
    //    - Fetching the list of adversaries from an external data file (e.g., targets.json)
    //      to keep the content separate from the structure, allowing for easier updates.
    //
    // 3. INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS:
    //    - Using a library like Chart.js or D3.js to create interactive graphs
    //      that visualize connections, campaign funding, or voting records.
    //
    // No active functionality is required at this stage, but the foundation is laid.
